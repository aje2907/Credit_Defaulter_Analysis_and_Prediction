# Credit_Defaulter_Analysis_and_Prediction
This project uses exploratory data analysis to identify patterns that can be used to detect potential credit defaulters. The data is used to identify the driving factors behind loan default and to assess the risk
associated with lending to customers. The goal is to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected, while also minimizing the risk of loss for the company.
